<h1 id = "Intro"><p class= "sender-column">The Highest Grossing Films of All Time</p></h1> <hr>
<article><p ><a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film">Films</a> generate income from several revenue streams, including <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_theater">theatrical exhibition</a>, home video, television broadcast rights, and merchandising. However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, 
    mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue),
    a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible,
     excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.</p></article>
    
     <article><p>Traditionally, war films, musicals, and historical dramas have been the most popular genres, but franchise films, such as the <a href="https://emmy-wolf.github.io/wa/wa3.html">Harry Potter</a> Franchise have been among the best performers of the 21st century. There is strong interest in the superhero genre, with eleven films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
         featuring among the nominal top-earners. The most successful superhero film, Avengers: Endgame, is also the second-highest-grossing film on the nominal earnings chart, and there are four films in total based on the Avengers comic books charting in the top twenty. Other Marvel Comics adaptations have 
         also had success with the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_in_film">Spider-Man</a> and X-Men properties, while films based on <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_in_film">Batman</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_in_film">Superman</a> from DC Comics have generally performed well. Star Wars is also represented in the nominal earnings chart with five films, while the Jurassic Park franchise features prominently. Although the nominal earnings 
         chart is dominated by films adapted from pre-existing properties and sequels, it is headed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film)">Avatar</a>, which is an original work. Animated family films have performed consistently well, with Disney films enjoying lucrative re-releases prior to the home-video era. Disney also enjoyed later success with films such 
         as Frozen and its sequel, Zootopia, and The Lion King (along with its computer-animated remake), as well as its Pixar division, of which Inside Out 2, Incredibles 2, and Toy Story 3 and 4 have been the best performers. Beyond Disney and Pixar animation, China's Ne Zha 2 (the highest-grossing animated film), and the 
         Despicable Me and Shrek series have met with the most success.</p></article>
        
         <article><p>While inflation has eroded the achievements of most films from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active. Besides the Star Wars and Superman franchises, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_films">James Bond</a> and <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla_(franchise)">Godzilla</a> films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. 
            Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then Gone with the Wind—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the 
            highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.</p></article>.

    <article><p>With a worldwide box-office gross of over $2.9 billion, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film)">Avatar</a> is proclaimed to be the "highest-grossing" film, but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do not take into account home video and television income, which can form a significant portion of a film's earnings. Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in, it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful. 
        Titanic earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals, in addition to the $2.2 billion it 
        grossed in theaters. While complete sales data are not available for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film)">Avatar</a>, it earned $345 million from 
        the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu-ray units in North America, and ultimately sold a total of thirty
         million DVD and Blu-ray units worldwide. After home video income is accounted for, both films have earned over 
         $3 billion each. Television broadcast rights also substantially add to a film's earnings and, as of 2010, a film often 
         earned the equivalent of as much as 20–25% of its theatrical box office for two television runs, on top of pay-per-view 
         revenues; Titanic earned a further $55 million from the NBC and HBO broadcast rights, equating to about 9% of its North American gross.</p>

         <article><p>When a film is highly exploitable as a commercial property, its ancillary revenues can dwarf its income from direct film sales. The Lion King (1994) earned over $2 billion in box-office and home video sales, but this pales in comparison to the $8 billion earned at box offices around the world by the stage adaptation. Merchandising can be extremely lucrative too: The Lion King also sold $3 billion of 
    merchandise, while Pixar's Cars—which earned $462 million in theatrical revenues and was only a modest hit by comparison to other Pixar films—generated global merchandise sales of over $8 billion in the five years after its 2006 release. Pixar had another huge hit with Toy Story 3, which generated almost $10 billion in merchandise retail sales in addition to the $1 billion it earned at the box office.</p></article>
            
    <article><p>On this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained. Seven films in total have grossed in excess of $2 billion worldwide, with Avatar ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period 
        do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.</p></article>

       <h2 id = "conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
       <p>The highest-grossing films of all time reflect not only advances in global distribution and marketing, but also broader trends in cinematic tastes and franchise dominance. In recent decades, the worldwide box office has become increasingly reliant on large-scale tentpole productions, often tied to established intellectual properties, shared cinematic universes, and expansive marketing campaigns. Franchises such as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Star Wars, Avatar, and Jurassic Park have consistently delivered billion-dollar performers, supported by strong international returns, especially from emerging markets like China.</p>
<p>Technological innovations have also played a significant role in box office success. Films released in IMAX, 3D, or with advanced visual effects often command higher ticket prices, boosting gross totals. Re-releases in international markets—particularly China—have allowed certain films, such as Avatar and Titanic, to reclaim or reinforce their positions in the rankings years after their original theatrical runs. Simultaneously, the rise of animated blockbusters has shown the genre’s broad commercial viability, with several titles—most recently Inside Out 2 and Ne Zha 2—achieving unprecedented global earnings.</p>
<p>While unadjusted grosses dominate public perception and media coverage, adjusted-for-inflation figures tell a different story. When considering inflation, legacy films like Gone with the Wind, Star Wars: A New Hope, and The Sound of Music emerge as historically significant financial successes, even surpassing many modern billion-dollar films in estimated ticket sales. As global markets continue to evolve and streaming platforms reshape viewing habits, the composition of the highest-grossing films list will likely continue to shift—balancing cultural impact, technological spectacle, and the enduring appeal of theatrical cinema.</p>
